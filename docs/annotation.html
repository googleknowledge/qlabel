  <h1>Annotation in HTML</h1>
  <p>
   Annotation means that your web page contains metadata about its text
   in the mark up.
   For qLabel, you can annotate a piece of text with a unique identifier, a URI,
   that identifies what the given text is about.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, you might say <i>&quot;I visited Vienna last year.&quot;</i>
   You could annotate the <i>&quot;I&quot;</i> with a URI for yourself,
   <i>&quot;Vienna&quot;</i> with a URI for Vienna, Michigan, using e.g. the
   Wikidata identifier <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7928351">Q7928351</a>
   (or <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7928354">Q7928354</a>, in case you
   meant the <em>other</em> Vienna, Michigan),
   and <i>&quot;last year&quot;</i> with an URI for the year.
   This makes it much easier to understand what this sentence is about
   (indeed, not only for the machine, as you have seen) and makes the context more explicit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Annotations can be useful well beyond of the service that qLabel offers, e.g. for
   a better search and for natural language processing, because now it is explicitly
   stated that this sentence is not about Vienna in Austria or Virginia,
   nor the Billy Joel song.
  </p>
  <p>
   With qLabel, we annotate the text in order to allow for the correct translation.
   For example, the Austrian Vienna would be translated to <em>Wien</em> in German,
   and to <em>B&eacute;cs</em> in Hungary, whereas the song or one of the US cities
   would remain untranslated.
  </p>
  <p>
   qLabel uses the <code>its-ta-ident-ref</code> attribute from the
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/">W3C ITS 2.0</a> recommendation.
   It is unfortunately a horrible attribute name that no one can remember.
   It stands for <b>I</b>nternationalization <b>T</b>ag <b>S</b>et (ITS)
   <b>T</b>ext <b>A</b>nnotation (TA)
   <b>Ident</b>ifier <b>ref</b>erence.

   Wikipedia has a decent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_annotation">article
   on annotation</a>.
