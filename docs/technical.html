  <h1>qLabel: Technical description</h1>
  <p>
   In the Semantic Web, every object of interest has a URI, a unique identifier.
   These URIs can be resolved in order to look up more data about the object,
   for example its label in different languages.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is exactly what qLabel does. These labels are then used to replace the
   text content of the annotated element, when so requested by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
   One frequent issue with the approach sketched above is that resolving every single
   URI one after the other simply takes a lot of time and resources.
   qLabel provides a mechanism to register different loaders, and even three example
   loaders (for Wikidata, Freebase, and the fallback Semantic Web loader).
   These loaders can be implemented much more efficiently (e.g. the Wikidata and
   Freebase loaders cut down the number of web requests by an order of magnitude
   and more). They also don't require the rdfquery library, so that you don't have
   to parse RDF/XML in the browser, which could further reduce your footprint.
  </p>
  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>
   The qLabel library adds the <code>$.qlabel</code> object that has the
   following public interface.
  </p>
  <h3>switchLanguage(lang)</h3>
  <p>
   Sets the language to <code>lang</code> (which is a ISO 639 language code)
   and changes the displayed text on the Website.
   It will first gather all annotating URIs from all elements that have class
   <code>qlabel</code>, check if these URIs are already known,
   load the unknown ones, and once they are all loaded, the text content of the
   elements changes if a label in the requested language exists.
   The function returns a <code>promise</code> that will resolve once the
   language has switched.
  </p>
  <h3>getLanguage()</h3>
  <p>
   Returns the ISO 639 language code that was set last.
  </p>
  <h3>setClassName(clsName)</h3>
  <p>
   Sets the class name used to find the elements that should be translated.
   The default class name is <code>qlabel</code>
  </p>
  <h3>getClassName()</h3>
  <p>
   Returns the class name used to find the elements that should be translated
   which was set last or <code>qlabel</code> if nothing was set.
  </p>
  <h3>getLabel(URI, lang)</h3>
  <p>
   Returns a label for the requested URI and language. If the URI is unknown,
   or if there is no label for the specified language for the requested URI,
   <code>undefined</code> is returned.
  </p>
  <h3>getLabels(URI)</h3>
  <p>
   Returns an object where the keys are the language codes and the values
   are the labels, for the requested URI. If the URI is unknown,
   <code>undefined</code> will be returned.
  </p>
  <h3>setLabel(URI, lang, label)</h3>
  <p>
   Provide qLabel with a Label for the given URI and language. Now, the URI
   is known (and will not be loaded when calling <code>switchLanguage</code>).
   <code>setLabel</code> can be used to set the labels manually and not load
   the labels for every user, and can thus safe resources.
  </p>
  <h3>loadLabels(URIs)</h3>
  <p>
   The parameter is optional. URIs is a list of URIs for which labels
   will be loaded. If they are already known, they will not be loaded.
   If URIs is empty, all annotating URIs on elements with the class
   <code>qlabel</code> will be loaded.
   The function returns a <code>promise</code> that will be resolved
   once the labels are loaded.
  </p>
  <h3>getKnownURIs()</h3>
  <p>
   Returns an array with all URIs that are known.
  </p>
  <h3>setLoader(tester, loader)</h3>
  <p>
   Sets a loader. A loader consists of two functions, a <code>tester</code>
   and a <code>loader</code>.
   The tester takes a single string and
   returns a (possibly normalized) string if the loader is able to load the
   given URI (and returns <code>undefined</code> else).
   The loader takes an array of strings that the loader will load.
   The loader should use the <code>setLabel</code> function to set all loaded
   labels, and return a promise which will be resolved once the loader is finished.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are three loaders already available: a Freebase loader, a Wikidata loader,
   and a generic Semantic Web loader using Linked Data principles.
  </p>
  <h3>setFreebaseKey(key)</h3>
  <p>
   Sets the Google Freebase API key to be used when calling Freebase.
  </p>
  <h3>getFreebaseKey()</h3>
  <p>
   Returns the previously set Google Freebase API key, or an empty string if none is set.
  </p>
  <h2>Open tasks and future of qLabel</h2>
  <p>
   I am not particularly keen on maintaining qLabel. The library is Open Source and
   I am happy if someone wants to take over maintenance and further development.
  </p>
  <p>
   A few open issues:
   <ul>
    <li>the Wikidata implementation currently only accepts up to 50 URIs at once</li>
    <li>
     currently, the <a href="http://any23.org">any23</a> service is used in order
     to circumvent same origin issues. It is not necessary to use the service every
     time. It would be smarter to first check if the original destination supports
     CORS, and only use any23 (or something similar) if it is required.
    </li>
    <li>SPARQL is never used, even though it can be much more efficient in specific cases</li>
    <li>error and exception handling are not implemented</li>
    <li>language fallback is not implemented</li>
    <li>there is no particularly strong reason to depend on jQuery (besides rdfquery)</li>
    <li>rdfquery seems to be unmaintained (but working)</li>
   </ul>
